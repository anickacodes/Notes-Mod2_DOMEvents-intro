Event listeners and handlers always go together.
two parts of one method

handling events
describe the action taken when the event has happened (open a pop-up, validate some input, etc. )

event listeners - listening to the response 
elements (button, h1, etc.) and events (click, hover etc.) will be actively listening.
ex: if someone is laughing at a show, speaker pauses to listen 


what does the stage look like before we set up ?
default - html 
lights, decorations - css

 * {
    margin: 0;
} target everything 

DOM content loading - an event 

allows everyything to load before anyything functional 

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1"); 
make it a variable 

the name of the tag (in the string) is what allows us to select the element
